# M2R
Year 2 group project


### ode_solver
* Solve and plot the odes for simple SI, SIR and SIRS models.

### SIR_Network_Simulation
* Based on Shiv's work https://github.com/galenys/SIR_Network_Dynamics_Simulation

### scale_free
* Use Barab√°si-Albert model to generate secle free graph.

### small_world
* Use Watts Strogatz model to generate graph with small-world property. (not very sure)

### modularity
* Stochastic block model partitions the nodes in blocks.
* We can use it to study the properties about modularity.
